## Main Idea
Unfortunately, this is the last project from the course, and now it is time to make a project based on whatever we learnt during the bootcamp. So, i decided to create a data vizualization and a application to help managers to make contracts with new players. All of my table content is from the website [Fifa Dataset](https://sofifa.com/players).

## Soccer and Data Analysis

* Help to achieve unknown players around the world
* Make contract with cheap players that have the requirements from the client
* Give new opportunities
* Make a team without paying too much on star players ( Moneyball movie as an example ) 

## Tools and Techniques 

* Python - Web Scrapping, Data manipulation and filtering  
* Tableau - Data Vizualization 
* Streamlit Application - System Recommendation 

## Libraries

* Pyforest
* tqdm.auto
* Pandas 
* Scipy
* Datetime
* Sklearn
* Numpy
* Bs4
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
